    "about": "I am a fifth year computer science student at Queen's University with a specialization in AI. I have a passion for solving problems using any new technologies I can get my hands on. For this reason, I have done a ton of work with modern concepts like Cloud Computing and AI Tools in both passion projects and on internship.\n\nI strongly believe in keeping an open mindset, and I am always on the lookout to try new things. To me, this is the best way to grow and become the best version of myself."
